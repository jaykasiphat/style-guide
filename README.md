# Web Style Guide
A Sass micro-framework which can be used to quickly prototype other websites

## Project
I built a responsive web style guide using Sass (SCSS).
I also learned to organize my code with SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) and name things better with BEM (Block, Element, Modifier).
